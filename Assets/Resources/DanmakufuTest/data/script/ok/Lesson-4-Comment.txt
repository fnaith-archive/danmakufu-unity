//This is a comment.
//Anything in Danmakufu that is preceded with two slashes (//) is a line comment.
//Therefore, anything past a // on a line is not treated as code by Danmakufu and will be ignored.
/*This is also a comment*/
//Comments inside /* and */ are considered 'block comments'.
/*Block
comments
can
span
multiple
lines*/
//Line comments are very good for providing descriptions of what certain code does.
//Line comments are also very good for commenting out code that you don't want to use right now, such as debug code.
/*Block Comments are useful for cutting out large chunks of code from execution 
in order to test one part of a script.*/
/*Block comments are also used to hold descriptive information about functions and the like*/
/*Block and Line comments work exactly the same as in Java, C, C++, and JavaScript*/
